# Uni-to-Grad-Job-Roadmap
A personal guide I made for friends based on my experience when getting a SWE graduate job!

## Intro:

So you want a grad job… Well welcome to the grind, it absolutely sucks… Sorry I should be more positive! It… erm… yeah no it sucks. Can't really spin this. But, hopefully this rough guide will help you to land one. This was my approach, not saying it's the gold standard, but considering the graduate unemployment sits at roughly 11% for compsci students, I'd wager it’s better than nothing!

## CV/Resume:

Chances are your CV is not up to scratch. That's to be expected, especially if you haven't done any internships.

Your university projects and dissertations are great to use to get started especially if you have no relevant experience. I have attached my CV as an example to the kind of structure companies would want when applying.

It is important relevant skills such as programming languages are in bold. If there is an automated system looking for these keywords it will be picked up.

## Project Ideas:

Now for whatever reason you may not have projects…

WHY DON'T YOU HAVE PROJECTS!?!?

There are only two reasons I can think of:
1. You **DIDN'T** take my advice in the CV/Resume section, in which case **LOOK UP**.
2. You're not a computer science student…

THAT'S OKAY! This means this section is for you!

Here are some project ideas, there will definitely be a tutorial for all of them:

1. Game! - just a simple one like a 2d maze, NOT the next FIFA.
2. Portfolio Website - ironically you may need projects to populate this one
3. Weather app - can find apis to pull the weather data
4. To-do app 
5. Messaging app
6. Social media app
7. Food tracker
8. e-commerce app 
9. Recommendation bot 
10. Chatbot
11. AN API (search it up)
12. Copycat app - an app that already exists try to build it yourself
13. Data visualisation using python

Note: Some projects will be harder than others. No shame in using a tutorial to complete them! The third bullet point is a link to open source projects that are geared towards beginners this is another greate way to show off your skills and passion (cringe). 

For any projects that are on github, I recommend getting familiar with git and github. I've added a link for this below:

## Wider community and asking questions:
- [CS Career questions EU](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/) can ask questions and see what other grads as well as more experienced people are asking. Also helps for figuring out you should be paid more for your work xD.
- Discord: There are loads of servers that contain programming communities that help you with problems or projects. I've provided a starting one: [print('Hello Creator')](https://discord.gg/rs4WDJVtfh)
- StackOverflow - community of other devs that are willing to help. BEWARE they can be mean.

## Preparing for Interviews:

Most companies will have multiple rounds for interviews. These roughly fall into two categories:
	- Behavioural 
	- Technical

It is important to prepare for both, you can be a strong coder and still fail as you suck social skills wise. For the technical interview make sure you have a programming language you are comfortable with. Most people recommend python or Java. You may be required to do the interview in the language you also applying for e.g. C++. So learn it and be very comfortable with it.

# Technical:
Technical interviews come in a number of forms:
- Phone interview - this is a simple phone call where you will share your screen via a coding whiteboard link. You won't see the interviewers face but you will be asked a coding question and will be able to ask clarifying questions. Tip: Practice leetcode and have a thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures. The problems asked are rooted in these. Other topics potentially asked are:
		- Dynamic programming - memoisation
	
- Take home Assignment - this can either be at the start or in later rounds. It usually an assignment that will take a couple of hours to complete, with instructions on the problem they want you to solve. It won't be a data structure or algo question but more like a mini coding project that is incomplete. 
	
- Whiteboard/zoomboard interview - This is the same as the phone interview except it will be in person of over zoom and can see each other and interact a bit more.
	
- Reviewing a past work (usually for new grads and interns) - This will be where the ask for a piece of work you have done. The interviewer will ask questions about design choices, ask about possible improvements that you could have done, or if you could do it again what would you do differently. Tip: make sure you are familiar with the project you are presenting. Looks worse if you don’t know what you did - you wrote it!
	
- Timed coding interview question - You're given a link to solve a coding question(s) usually a leetcode question. You have x amount of minutes. Solve it/them before then.  Make sure to include comments and code in a way that is clear but also efficient. No point making an efficient code but hard to read.
