# Uni-to-Grad-Job-Roadmap
A personal guide I made for friends based on my experience when getting a SWE graduate job!

## Intro:

So you want a grad job… Well welcome to the grind, it absolutely sucks… Sorry I should be more positive! It… erm… yeah no it sucks. Can't really spin this. But, hopefully this rough guide will help you to land one. This was my approach, not saying it's the gold standard, but considering the graduate unemployment sits at roughly 11% for compsci students, I'd wager it’s better than nothing!

## CV/Resume:

Chances are your CV is not up to scratch. That's to be expected, especially if you haven't done any internships.

Your university projects and dissertations are great to use to get started especially if you have no relevant experience. I have attached my CV as an example to the kind of structure companies would want when applying.

It is important relevant skills such as programming languages are in bold. If there is an automated system looking for these keywords it will be picked up.

## Project Ideas:

Now for whatever reason you may not have projects…

WHY DON'T YOU HAVE PROJECTS!?!?

There are only two reasons I can think of:
1. You **DIDN'T** take my advice in the CV/Resume section, in which case **LOOK UP**.
2. You're not a computer science student…

THAT'S OKAY! This means this section is for you!

Here are some project ideas, there will definitely be a tutorial for all of them:

1. Game! - just a simple one like a 2d maze, NOT the next FIFA.
2. Portfolio Website - ironically you may need projects to populate this one
3. Weather app - can find apis to pull the weather data
4. To-do app 
5. Messaging app
6. Social media app
7. Food tracker
8. e-commerce app 
9. Recommendation bot 
10. Chatbot
11. AN API (search it up)
12. Copycat app - an app that already exists try to build it yourself
13. Data visualisation using python

Note: Some projects will be harder than others. No shame in using a tutorial to complete them! The third bullet point is a link to open source projects that are geared towards beginners this is another greate way to show off your skills and passion (cringe). 

For any projects that are on github, I recommend getting familiar with git and github. I've added a link for this below:
