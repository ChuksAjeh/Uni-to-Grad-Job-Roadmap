# Uni-to-Grad-Job-Roadmap
A personal guide I made for friends based on my experience when getting a SWE graduate job!

## Intro:

So you want a grad job… Well welcome to the grind, it absolutely sucks… Sorry I should be more positive! It… erm… yeah no it sucks. Can't really spin this. But, hopefully this rough guide will help you to land one. This was my approach, not saying it's the gold standard, but considering the graduate unemployment sits at roughly 11% for compsci students, I'd wager it’s better than nothing!
