# Uni-to-Grad-Job-Roadmap
A personal guide I made for friends based on my experience when getting a SWE graduate job or Internship!

## Intro:

So you want a grad job or internship… Well welcome to the grind, it absolutely sucks… Sorry I should be more positive! It… erm… yeah no it sucks. Can't really spin this. But, hopefully this rough guide will help you to land one. This was my approach, not saying it's the gold standard, but considering the graduate unemployment sits at roughly 11% for compsci students, I'd wager it’s better than nothing!

![smile meme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22524187/161431503-d5f622ef-9d9d-41d5-ab43-3228ce52dee7.jpg)

I know some of you like your sources: [Study International](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/uk-computer-science-has-the-highest-rate-of-unemployed-graduates/)

Lastly, before we begin, you might be wondering why all this information is plastered here on a repo. Well, I'm not going to pretend to be noble and say "ItS BeCaUsE I WaNt EvErYoNe tO wIn!". Gross no, I don't know you, and I don't care to. Information should be free and easy to find. Plus I get to ruin a YouTube/Tiktok content creators day by making it so you don't get roped into their crappy course on how to get into tech like some forex bro. FYI, they probably just got into it themselves.  

## CV/Resume:

Chances are your CV is not up to scratch. That's to be expected really, especially if you haven't done any internships.

Your university projects and dissertations are great to use to get started especially if you have no relevant experience. I have attached my CV as an example to the kind of structure companies would want when applying.

[Template CV Upload.docx](https://github.com/ChuksAjeh/Uni-to-Grad-Job-Roadmap/files/8496698/Template.CV.Upload.docx)

It is important relevant skills such as programming languages are in bold. If there is an automated system looking for these keywords it will be picked up.

## Project Ideas:

Now for whatever reason you may not have projects…


![bbal](https://media.giphy.com/media/xL7PDV9frcudO/giphy.gif)


WHY DON'T YOU HAVE PROJECTS!?!?

There are only two reasons I can think of:
1. You **DIDN'T** take my advice in the CV/Resume section, in which case **LOOK UP**.
2. You want projects besides your academic work (that makes sense)
3. You're not a computer science student…

THAT'S OKAY! This means this section is for you.

Here are some project ideas, there will definitely be a tutorial for all of them:

1. Game! - just a simple one like a 2d maze, NOT the next FIFA.
2. Portfolio Website - ironically you may need projects to populate this one
3. Weather app - can find apis to pull the weather data
4. To-do app 
5. Messaging app
6. Social media app
7. Food tracker
8. e-commerce app 
9. Recommendation bot 
10. Chatbot
11. AN API (search it up)
12. Copycat app - an app that already exists try to build it yourself
13. Data visualisation using python

Here are some links to places with more ideas:

- [1000+ Beginner Programming Projects (x-post /r/programming) : learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2a9ygh/1000_beginner_programming_projects_xpost/)
- [MunGell/awesome-for-beginners: A list of awesome beginners-friendly projects.](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)

- [project-based-learning by programming language](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning)
 	
Note: Some projects will be harder than others. No shame in using a tutorial to complete them! The third bullet point is a link to open source projects that are geared towards beginners this is another greate way to show off your skills and passion (cringe). I will add a small caveat/aside. You are competing against other candidates. Choosing the more mainstream, easy to do projects, means you are less likely to stand out (what I mean is 1000 other people also did that project... probably choose something else).

### Update - 2023/4: 
Since I made this guide the market has become a lot more competitive. I would strongly recommend more unique and challenging projects rather than the traditional To-Do app. Maybe speak to people and see what problems people are having and how you could solve them. Maybe a church needs a website that can handle donations? Help them out. This shows experience working with a client

Also I would recommend more complete projects - create projects that cover multiple areas of domain knowledge e.g. Create a web app. learn to dockerise the application, and deploy it to a cloud environment, (SAFELY, you don't want to wake up to a £20,000 bill), like google clout platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS). Document your process and how to run/connect to the project. In this example you've worked with a language for backend, for frontend, docker, and a clould technology like 

For any projects that are on github, I recommend getting familiar with git and github. I've added a link for this below:

[Learn Git in 15minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)

## Wider community and asking questions:

- [CS Career questions EU](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/) can ask questions and see what other grads as well as more experienced people are asking. Also helps for figuring out you should be paid more for your work xD.
- Discord: There are loads of servers that contain programming communities that help you with problems or projects. I've provided a starting one: [print('Hello Creator')](https://discord.gg/rs4WDJVtfh)
- StackOverflow - community of other devs that are willing to help. BEWARE they can be mean.

## Open Source:

Another great way to get experience/showcase your skills is by contributing to open source. And when I mean contribute, I do not mean correcting a spelling mistake in the README or documentation. DON'T DO THAT. That's weird. 

What I mean is picking up a genuine issue that seems interesting and accessible to you with your current skills, and trying to solve the issue. Reach out to the maintainers if you have questions, ask them if you can pick it up if it has been open for a while, or just take it and open a PR. A maintainer might suggest changes, or they might say it doesn't totally suck and merge it in! A great place to look for first or easy issues is the following site:

- [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissue.dev/)

Here you can find issues sorted by programming language with varying projects from graphics to parsers to logging analytics. Anything. Contributing to these is a great way to stand out because it is not a templated project from scratch, it's an existing codebase with history, which means you need to wrap your head around someone else's code. Something you will do regularly in industry. Additionally it's not some project that a youtuber said on youtube that will now be on a hundred other CVs/Resumes.

A piece of advice: It can be daunting contributing to open source. You will likely feel that people know more than you (they do. Sorry!) or that you aren't qualified to add to the codebase. Open source is open source for a reason it is for everyone to contribute to the overall canvas that is the project. Have a go, if your solution is rejected or there's changes requested, it is a learning experience. You might come across a way you haven't even considered coding in before just because you're so new to the field. 

## Freelancing:

Another option is to freelance! What better way to sharpen your skills and hopefully gain permanent employment than doing projects and purposefully getting underpaid... wait... What? Tongue-in-cheek joke aside, freelancing allows you to actually sell yourself and your skills and build experience taking client requirements and then translating that into a product to then sell. Whilst it is not exactly like corporate/startup work, given you are by yourself for the most part, this helps put projects on the CV that are real world applications. Something a lot of candidate especially new to the industry tend to lack. Sites that are great for getting start are:

- [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/?source=top_nav)
- [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/ab/account-security/login?redir=%2F)

I will say this isn't the easiest however. There are many people that will offer similar services but landing even 1-2 and completing them will look good on the ol' resume.

## Hackathons:

Hackathons are a great way to meet people and network especially if they are company sponsored/led. Plus they do look good on the CV. They are usually fairly easy to find just a search online and you should find ones that are local to you or are even online only. I would say that these should not be the main part of you application, moreso something that enhances your CV. You ultimately want projects/bodies of work that showcase your skills.

## Preparing for Interviews:

Most companies will have multiple rounds for interviews. These roughly fall into two categories:
	- Behavioural 
	- Technical

It is important to prepare for both, you can be a strong coder and still fail as you suck social skills wise. For the technical interview make sure you have a programming language you are comfortable with. Most people recommend python or Java. You may be required to do the interview in the language you also applying for e.g. C++. So learn it and be very comfortable with it.

### Technical:

Technical interviews come in a number of forms:
- **Phone interview** - this is a simple phone call where you will share your screen via a coding whiteboard link. You won't see the interviewers face but you will be asked a coding question and will be able to ask clarifying questions. **Tip: Practice leetcode and have a thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures. The problems asked are rooted in these. Other topics potentially asked are: Dynamic programming - memoisation**
	
- **Take home Assignment** - this can either be at the start or in later rounds. It usually an assignment that will take a couple of hours to complete, with instructions on the problem they want you to solve. It won't be a data structure or algo question but more like a mini coding project that is incomplete. 
	
- **Whiteboard/zoomboard interview** - This is the same as the phone interview except it will be in person of over zoom and can see each other and interact a bit more.
	
- **Reviewing a past work (usually for new grads and interns)** - This will be where the ask for a piece of work you have done. The interviewer will ask questions about design choices, ask about possible improvements that you could have done, or if you could do it again what would you do differently. **Tip: make sure you are familiar with the project you are presenting. Looks worse if you don’t know what you did - you wrote it!**
	
- **Timed coding interview question** - You're given a link to solve a coding question(s) usually a leetcode question. You have x amount of minutes. Solve it/them before then.  Make sure to include comments and code in a way that is clear but also efficient. No point making an efficient code but hard to read. 

#### Leetcode:

Ahh the dreaded leetcode. It's like Dark Souls or if we're being up to date, Elden Ring. There is only one thing you can do for this: GIT GUD. That's it. Why you might ask?  This is where you will find most if not all interview questions by companies. Other sites do questions too, like hackerrank, codility etc. But these places are where you will do the interview questions by companies when they send links or want to pair over zoom for an interview etc. Leetcode is HARD. Even the easy questions. Don’t be upset if you can't do them just yet, practice makes perfect! Luckily I'm not so mean as to not give you the the resources to actually get better:

- Leetcode - The site where the interview questions are. In a perfect world a leetcode question a day and you're golden. Obviously, do more if you're trying to get a job. Most interview questions will be at medium level: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
	
-  75 leetcode questions. A super nice engineer broke down the pattern and style that most coding interviews come in. they fall into a number of specific groups. I recommend using this to become proficient at leetcode: [75 Leetcode questions](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/#week-1---sequences)
	
Understanding data structures (don’t need to watch it all ): [Data Structures Easy to Advanced Course - Full Tutorial from a Google Engineer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM)

These youtubers are my go to if you ever get stuck:
- [Nick White](https://www.youtube.com/c/NickWhite)
- [CSDojo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CSDojo)
- [Kevin Naughton Jr](https://www.youtube.com/c/KevinNaughtonJr)
- [Back to Back SWE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJz2DV1a3yfgrR7GqRtUUA)

### Behavioural:
When going into this it is important to:
	- To know the company and its values
	- A piece of recent news about the company
	- STAR technique - make sure you know this inside and out MANGA/FAANG and big bank companies love this…

Formats:
- CV review culture fit interview: This is to see if you have the relevant experience and fit in the company culture. It is important your answers align with the company values SUBTLY so as to show you are what they are looking for. 
- Situational Judgement questions - these are usually automated so you can choose but they are games to see if you are a fit again. Make sure to answer truthfully but in a way that aligns with company values. 

The worst thing you can be is not prepared, just wasting your own time and an application really. No seriously, some companies ban you from applying again for 6-12 months…

## Job Postings:

After prepping for interviews it's time to find a job to interview for! That's where these links come in.

 Don’t just look at Gradcracker! Build relationships with recruiters
- LinkedIn - Set Up Alerts for Junior developer and Graduate Roles
- GradCracker - more for grad Schemes not immediate though - [Gradcracker](https://www.gradcracker.com/)
- Oho Group - High Paying fintech usually like C++ - [Oho Group](https://www.oho.co.uk/)
- ITecco - register and/or call have bunch of dev and grad jobs most students will never see - [Itecco](https://www.itecco.co.uk/jobs?query=junor+developer&commit=)
- Client Server - These recruiters will usually call you about jobs - [Client Server](https://www.client-server.com/)
- MilkRound - another good one for grads - [MilkRound](https://www.milkround.com/)
- Levels.fyi - this is where you can find salaries for the positions you're applying to recommend using it to be informed when you're applying. - [Level.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Facebook,Microsoft&track=Software%20Engineer)

Please remember that hiring is done in cycles. **DO NOT**, I repeat DO NOT wait until university is over. **THERE WILL BE NOTHING LEFT**. For some reason university students get the bright idea to apply at the end of FINAL year. I can't tell whether it's laziness or the fear of juggling multiple commitments. Regardless, you don't want to be like this with your friends when they get offers now do you:

![EZ5JJspWAAg9Sod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22524187/162072451-8e894f5a-582a-4599-a359-957dfbcc8caf.jpg)


SO, apply **early** negotiate the starting date THEN relax. In my experience cycles are typically:

**August - January/Februrary/March** - Big Investment Banks, hedge funds, Finance companies, top fintech, FAANG (Pay really well! Super competitive) Note: FAANG/MANGA stands for Meta/Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix Microsoft. Apply early. (Pay: £35/45k - £100k+) Note: very few companies are 100+ and are very competitive e.g Jane Street is £200k but they're probably taking like two grads across the country.

**Note: For legal reasons, I don't know how many grads Jane street take and exact grad pay, it's just to emphasise my point on how hard it is to get it in and that I know pay is well above normal grad salary of £25k. Don't come for my neck!**

**Jan  -March/May** - Everyone else. All the 'standard' companies (Pay is average or slightly above £25-30k) and some great companies, real diamonds also start during this time

**May - June onwards** - End of uni (bad reality) - This is about the scraps… If you wait till the end of uni, be prepared to find the scraps (companies no one wants to go to) or small companies still open (startups, small companies, companies with nonstandard hiring drives etc) if you find a good company congrats you're lucky. But if you're looking for a good/big company, well you're too late. Better luck next year.

These are my rough estimates for timelines of companies of all ranges. As you can see the is a large overlap and hiring drives change all the time. If unsure just message a recruiter on LinkedIn, they don't care they'll happy tell you, also COULD, put you in their good books for being proactive. Again, If you don’t want to be disappointed **APPLY EARLY**. I don’t want to scare you I'm just being honest. Saw enough of my fellow cohort and linkedIn posts to make this case.

Don’t be this guy ->

**Note: For legal reasons, please understand I am not belittling anyone, this is intended to be tongue in cheek, whilst giving good advice. I am well aware there are students that did all of the above and still didn’t get a grad job. The game is the game, I am just trying for people to be in the best position they can be in. Don't come for my neck!**

## Keep Track of Applications:
It's important to keep track of your applications and their status. It will make it easier, when looking at offers their deadlines and then being able to negotiate. Also important to have that friend to cry on when you see all the red highlights from rejections. :joy:

## Final Words:

GOOD LUCK! It's going to be hard, there'll be a few absolute bombers, a few close ones, but ultimately, you will land one just keep pushing on!
